- 👋 Hi, I’m @dylbester
- 👀 I’m interested in automation to increase capacity and work efficiency, the great outdoors - backpacking, snowboarding, rafting, you name it! - and preserving this beautiful 
  planet of ours, football (soccer for some) and greater community development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science through the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, Computer Science, Python and Java through Codecademy, and ML through Coursera.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects that can challenge me such as a budgeting .py that takes bank statements and writes your budget out with OpenPYXL or html3py interfaces for finance.
- How to reach me - email! dnbester2@gmail.com.
